👋 Hi there! I’m Dilkhush jangid 
👀 I’m interested in web development and ML/AI, particularly in creating dynamic and responsive applications.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web projects, especially those that push the boundaries of user experience and functionality.
📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at dilkhush@example.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
